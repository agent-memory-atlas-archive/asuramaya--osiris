"""osiris init — take a fresh migrated DB to a usable console.

A fresh install is an empty shell: the migrations create the tables but seed NOTHING, so a
clean DB has 0 compositions and an empty design canon. The console lands on nothing and
`run_composition('decision-log')` returns "no composition" — the README's promised question
can't be answered. This one idempotent command seeds the default compositions (mirroring the
proven dev-instance shape) and ingests the design canon (docs/reference/ + own docs, the
substrate `consult_canon` reads), so a fresh box has a working console right after
`alembic upgrade head`.

    python -m src.init --compositions-only   # deploy step: sync DEFAULT_COMPOSITIONS into a
                                              # LIVE DB, skip the (slow, unrelated) canon
                                              # ingest — ruling 2ee43411, task #63: adding a
                                              # default composition is a first-class deploy step,
                                              # never a raw asyncpg heredoc against the live DB.

ROOM RETIREMENT (decision 31717ca7, Thoth DM 10884/10792, thread 10820): rooms are retired —
the operator's own word was "scope really died and made itself obsolete... gotta remove that
too." Every default composition seeds GLOBAL (room_id NULL); there is no ROOM_CONFIG here to
re-grow the concept on a fresh box. Migration 0070 backfills the 31 compositions that were
scoped on existing installs into `former_room_id`, a standing record, never re-populated by
this command; the `rooms` table itself stays (read-only, never dropped).

Idempotent: compositions upsert by name, the canon find-or-creates on canonical — so re-running
only fixes drift and never duplicates (asserted in tests/test_init.py).

NB the canon step reads repo-relative doc paths (docs/reference/, docs/COMPOSER.md, …) via
`ingest_canon` — same convention as `python -m src.ingest.reference`, so run it from the repo
root (the CLI `main()` chdir's there to be safe; the pure `init()` relies on CWD).

# ACQUIRE-WAIT INSTRUMENTATION (thread e4a5755a): the only existing pool_health surface
# (pg_activity_by_app) reads pg_stat_activity — an INSTANTANEOUS backend-count snapshot,
# which cannot answer "does anything actually queue for a connection," because queueing
# happens client-side, before a backend is even involved. A bounded per-pool sample deque
# (never unbounded — a long-lived daemon pool must not leak memory one sample at a time)
# is the cheapest way to answer it: time acquire()'s own wait specifically (not the whole
# checkout-to-release lifetime), read back via `pool_acquire_wait_stats(pool)`
# (src/orchestrator/pool_health.py wires it in).
#
# WHY A SUBCLASS, NOT INSTANCE MONKEYPATCHING: asyncpg.Pool is a plain (non-Cython)
# class but declares __slots__ — `pool.acquire = ...` on a live instance raises
# AttributeError (confirmed live: "attribute 'acquire' is read-only"), so the wrap has
# to happen at the CLASS level instead: briefly swap `asyncpg.pool.Pool` for
# `_TimedPool` for the span of `create_pool`'s own call below — see that function's
# own comment for exactly how wide the swap has to stay and why.

# THE ACQUIRE BOUND (2026-09-29 wedge): asyncpg's own acquire() default is timeout=None,
# wait forever. A pool-starvation deadlock (every connection held by a coroutine that is
# itself parked in a second acquire) therefore never surfaced as an error: tool calls
# just hung and the watchdog logged "SLOW TOOL CALL" every 30s with nothing to name. A
# pool built by create_pool(..., acquire_timeout=N) now bounds every acquire (including
# the implicit ones behind pool.fetch/fetchval/execute) and raises PoolStarved, a named
# TimeoutError, instead of parking forever. An explicit acquire(timeout=...) still wins.

# PINNED POOL (2026-09-29 wedge): a coroutine that takes a transaction-scoped advisory
# lock (mint_lock, _seat_lock, _peer_lock) holds one pooled connection for the lock's
# whole life. Its body used to keep calling `actions.pool.*`, each a SECOND acquire from
# the same pool: with N such holders in flight (a statusline /heartbeat burst fanning
# live_succession across N lineages, or any gather of mint-locked calls) and N >= the pool
# size, every slot is a locked holder waiting for a slot. Measured live: 5 mint: holders
# idle-in-transaction on their lock, 3 more slots churning through lock_timeout waiters,
# every holder parked in pool.acquire() forever.
#
# The structural fix: the lock yields a PinnedPool, a pool-shaped view of the locked
# connection. Everything the body does through it (pool.fetch*/execute, pool.acquire(),
# Actions(pinned) and every helper that takes a pool) runs on that ONE connection, so a
# locked body can never ask the pool for a second slot. Each call runs in its own
# SAVEPOINT, which keeps the old per-call failure isolation (a failed best-effort read no
# longer poisons the lock's transaction) while nothing escapes the lock's connection.
# The body's writes now commit when the lock releases (the same instant the next waiter
# can see them), and an exception escaping the lock body rolls them back together.
# Single-task by construction: two tasks driving one connection concurrently is refused
# by asyncpg itself ("another operation is in progress"), loud, never a hang.
